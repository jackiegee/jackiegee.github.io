  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>The Villas at Conch Shell was developed by Daphne and Philip Hippster who were both born and raised in Gros-Islet, St. Lucia. The villa was originally known as Daphils and was a three-story, 10 room guest house with a modest Bed and Breakfast.</p>
  <p>Over the years, the demand for short term rentals grew tremendously in St. Lucia, particularly in the northern region of the island - as people wanted to be near all the action and night life that St. Lucia had to offer.</p>
  <p>After extending the propery and undergoing a two year renovation phase, Daphils was converted to eight, one and two-bedroom Villas and has been the go to spot for visitors from all over the world wanting to experience a slice of St. Lucia. Although the villas are modern, they were built with some local "flava" and visitors return year after year for this luxurious yet home-like feel. Whether it is families seeking adventure, couples looking for romance and relaxation, or friends needing that much needed get-away, the Villas at Conch Shell provides it all.</p>

  <p> We invite you to come experience St. Lucia your way. You won't be dissapointed!</p>
