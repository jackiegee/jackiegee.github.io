<p>After extending the propery and undergoing a two year renovation phase, Daphils was converted to eight, one and two-bedroom Villas and has been the go to spot for visitors from all over the world wanting to experience a slice of St. Lucia. Although the villas are modern, they were built with some local "flava" and visitors return year after year for this luxurious yet home-like feel. Wheter it is families seeking adventure, couples looking for romance and relaxation, or friends needing that much needed get-away, Sunset Villas at Conch Shell provides it all.

<h2>What our guests are saying ....</h2>

<p>"We had such a wonderful stay at the Villas. I came for the first time with my husband on our second anniversary and have stayed here five times over the past 4 years. Ms. Daph the owner was so warm and friendly. The local breakfast is the best ever! Every morning we would get the local breakfast of cocoa tea (made with real cocoa) and salt fish and a float (which is flour-like batter which is fried)." <a href="#">Read More</a></p>
<p>" I absolutely love it here! This is our first visit to the island of St. Lucia and it won't be the last! Me and two of my girlfriends had blast. Our favourite night activity was the Friday night street fair in Gros-Islet. We enjoyed the blast of caribbean music, people dancing in the streets, and of course, the delicious local cuisine sold at every corner by local vendors." <a href="#">Read More</a></p>
