<p>Over the years, the demand for short term rentals grew tremendously in St. Lucia, particularly in the northern region of the island - as people wanted to be near all the action and night life that St. Lucia had to offer.</p>
<p>After extending the propery and undergoing a two year renovation phase, Daphils was converted to 8 modern one and two bedroom villas and renamed Sunset Villas at Conch Shell. </p>

<div id="reviews">
<p>"We had such a wonderful stay at the Villas. I came for the first time with my husband on our second anniversary and have stayed here five times over the past 4 years. Ms. Daph the owner was so warm and friendly. The local breakfast is the best ever! Every morning we would get the local breakfast of cocoa tea (made with real cocoa) and salt fish and a float (which is flour-like batter which is fried)." <a href="#">Read More</a></p>
<p>" I absolutely love it here! This is our first visit to the island of St. Lucia and won't be the last! Me and two of my girlfriends had blast. Our favourite night activity was the Friday night street fair in Gros-Islet every Friday. You walk in the streers to local music, people dancing in the streers, vendors on every corner selling Barbeque chicken, roast pork, grilled conch on a stick which the St. Lucians call "lambi" which is the French term, roast fish and so much more." <a href="#">Read More</a></p>
